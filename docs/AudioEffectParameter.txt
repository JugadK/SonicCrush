Audio Effect Parameter is used so we can communicate the string parameters stored in the valueTree 
to the actual AudioEffect classes that manipulate the examples. Since they are strings one way we can do this is 
by storing the strings in a way that can be decoded into a C++ Object (This object being AudioEffectParameter)

p_customDistortion_equationName

p_, or the first two index of the string represent that it is a parameter 
customDistortion means the parameter belongs to the customDistortion effect (exact keywords can be found in the valueMap in EffectChain)
equationName is the name of the parameter

by passing the string into the AudioEffectParameter constructor along with a value (which is implemented using std::variant to be extendable), 
it will create an AudioEffectParameter, this can then be passed into EffectChain.addEffectParameter which will find the correct audioeffect and pass the parameter to it.
